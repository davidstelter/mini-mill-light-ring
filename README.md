# Mini Mill Ring Light

Inspired by a nice looking product at
http://www.phenomengineering.com/blog/the-photonx2-mini-mill-light-is-here though there appear to be
a number of competitors and other DIY solutions around.

Using a cheap "headlight halo/angel eyes" kit intended for car headlights, I got a 2-pack for like
$12 off Amazon, for the mini mill an 80mm light is a good fit. The ones I got have double-stick foam
tape on the back as well as 3 mounting tabs, recesses to engage these tabs are included when the
customizer option `subtractLightTabRecess` is checked/true.

Sticks to the mill with magnets so it's easy to remove if you need to attach a dial fixture to the
spindle or whatever. I used 8mm x 3mm neodymium disc magnets affixed with superglue, the magnet
recesses are sized accordingly for a good interference fit, but I found the magnets pulled out
sometimes when temporarily sticking the light on a larger ferrous surface so the superglue is
recommended to prevent this.

Use the [OpenSCAD customizer](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/OpenSCAD_User_Manual/Customizer) to
print as two pieces, one is the main body which the light ring, dc jack, magnets etc. all mount to,
and the other is a shroud that slips over it with a friction fit. The shroud is optional but without
it the light gets in your eyes almost as much as down on the work surface. I added a thin strip of
aluminum flashing tape to the inside of the shroud as a light reflector, hard to tell for sure
without a light meter but it does seem to increase the brightness of the illuminated work area
somewhat.

See the `stls/` directory for pre-rendered files for the main body and the shroud.
